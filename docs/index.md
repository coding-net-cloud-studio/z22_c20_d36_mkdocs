# MkDocs

Project documentation with&nbsp;Markdown.

---

## Overview

MkDocs is a **fast**, **simple** and **downright gorgeous** static site
generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation
source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML
configuration file. Start by reading the [introductory tuorial], then check the 
[User Guide] for more information.

### Host anywhere

MkDocs builds completely static HTML sites that you can host on GitHub pages,
Amazon S3, or [anywhere][deploy] else you choose.

### Great themes available

There's a stack of good looking [themes] available for MkDocs. Choose between
the built in themes: [mkdocs] and [readthedocs], select one of the third-party
themes listed on the [MkDocs Themes] wiki page, or [build your own].

### Preview your site as you work

The built-in dev-server allows you to preview your documentation as you're
writing it. It will even auto-reload and refresh your browser whenever you save
your changes.

### Easy to customize

Get your project documentation looking just the way you want it by [customizing
your theme] and/or installing some [plugins]. Modify Markdown's behavior with
[markdown_extensions]. See the full list of [configuration options] available.
